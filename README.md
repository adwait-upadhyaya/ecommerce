# E-Commerce App

This is a fully functional e-commerce web application built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Sass**, with **Redux** for state management and **Redux Toolkit Query** for handling API calls. The app allows users to browse categories, add items to the cart, update quantities, and remove items, providing a seamless shopping experience.

## Features

- **Category Browsing**: View products by categories (e.g., Women, Men, Electronics, Jewelry).
- **Cart Management**: Add items to the cart, update the quantity of each item, and remove items from the cart.
- **State Management**: The application uses Redux for managing the global state of the cart and products.
- **API Integration**: Uses Redux Toolkit Query to fetch product data from an external API.
- **Sass Styling**: Custom styles are built with Sass to enable modular and reusable stylesheets.
- **TypeScript**: Type safety is ensured across the application using TypeScript.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: UI framework for building the app.
- **Redux**: Used for state management (cart, product listings).
- **Redux Toolkit Query**: For fetching and caching product data from APIs.
- **Sass**: For styling the application.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed programming to prevent runtime errors.
